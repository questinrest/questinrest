# Hi there, I'm Aman Mishra(@questinrest)! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a final-year MSc Data Science student at the Defence Institute of Advanced Technology, Pune. Passionate about all things AI and constantly learning how to push the boundaries of what's possible with data.

### 👀 What I’m interested in

- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**: I have built a strong foundation in ML and DL, and I’m constantly improving my skills in these areas.
- **Machine Unlearning**: Currently, I’m diving into the fascinating world of machine unlearning, with a focus on **zero-shot machine unlearning** – the idea of making a model forget specific data without retraining it from scratch.
- **Data Privacy & Ethics**: The intersection of AI with ethical concerns and data privacy really excites me, especially how machine unlearning can impact these areas.

### 🌱 What I’m currently learning

- **Zero-Shot Based Machine Unlearning**: Exploring novel methods for teaching models to “unlearn” data they've been trained on, without starting from scratch. 
- **Advanced NLP**: I'm deepening my understanding of natural language processing with transformer models like BERT and GPT.
- **Generative AI**: I’m also exploring cutting-edge work in generative models, from GANs to diffusion models.
